> Steps in ML model fitting 
1. Load dataset
2. Split into train-test
3. Train the model using 'fit' method 
   1. Fit the mode and know the value coef from mode.coef_
   2. The most and the least value of coeff used to understand which coefficient affect the most and least the model
   3. Perform normalization and standardization
4. Test the trained model using 'predict' method
5. Compute the test metric and print
